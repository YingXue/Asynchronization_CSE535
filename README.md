CSE535 Final Project
=====
###This is the final project for CSE 535 aiming at implementing NS protocol using ERLANG.<br/>
		Each folder is a different version.
		To run the program, run it separately in each folder.
		Compile each file in the the folder, using c(**module name**) in erl, 
		and then simply run >driver: setup_env(). 

		To run test cases, put testcase.erl in each folder respectively, 
		compile it, and run >testcase: start(N). 
		N is of your choice which is the number of times that the protocol will be executed.
